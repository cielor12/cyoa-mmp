    <p>Going through the mountains, your team encountered the most dangerous goblins "The Otlaabs", they use deadly plants to destroy their enemies</p>
    <p>The ratio is 3 to 1 right now. But Aeden says that the rest of the team should continue to move forward and that he will take care of the goblins himself.</p>
    <p>You don't want to leave him alone with all of them. But you also can't stay for this delay</p>
    <p>Do you let Aeden fight of the goblins and their deadly plants?</p>
