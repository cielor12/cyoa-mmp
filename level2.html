    <ul>
      <li>Aeden: Ability to tell plants what to do</li>
      <li>Briar: Has the strength of two giants</li>
      <li>Camille: Has the power to see creatures true intentions</li>
      <li>Marlie: Has the most strategic tactics to get things done </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You know that in order to get Oflia, the trolls home. You have to go through The Forest of Cries, The Decaying Fields, Boothhime Mountains</p>
    <p>But Marlie, tells you that going through the Forest of Cries isn't smart. Since that's where the Green Pixies live, that you don't have time for that kind of trouble.</p>
    <p>Marlie says it's better to go through The Irant Firelands, although it will take a day more to get to Oflia. But if you go through The Forest of Cries, you will have to fight and that will take longer or you will fail</p>
    <p>Arlette says the decision is up to you. Are we going through The Forest of Cries?</p>
