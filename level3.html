    <p>You decided to go through The Irant Firelands. Although you didn't want to go through it. You've found that it is a shortcut to the Boothhime Mountains. Which will get you to Oflia much faster.</p>
    <p>The only problem now is that you didn't plan to go through The Irant Firelands, so you didn't bring enough water for all of your team. You have enough to rescue the queen but not for the return. You can make it last. If you all limit yourselfs enough</p>
